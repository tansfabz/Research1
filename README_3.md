# AI in Medical Fields



### What is AI and how does this function?

Artificial intelligence is a field of science that pursues the goal of creating intelligent applications and machines that can replicate human cognitive behavior. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are subsets of AI. [8]

### Machine learning:

It implies training algorithms to solve tasks independently using pattern recognition. For example, researchers can apply ML algorithms to radiology by training them to recognize pneumonia in lung cancers.

### Deep learning:

It relies on neural networks with artificial neurons modelled after a human brain. These networks have multiple hidden layers and can derive more insights than linear algorithms. Deep learning algorithms are widely used to reconstruct medical images and enhance their quality.

With its improved productivity and accuracy, AI is revolutionizing medical imaging. According to Signify Research, the world market for AI in medical imaging- comprising software for automated detection, quantification, decision support and diagnosis will reach US$2 billion by 2023. [9]

### Diagnosing diseases:

Machine learning algorithms are able to learn diagnosing diseases in a similar way to doctors. However, the algorithms need to be trained, and for this they need a lot of concrete examples. These examples need to be digitalized- machines can not read the lines in textbooks. [1]

AI is being used in a number of fields at the moment, which include detecting lung cancer or strokes based on CT scans, assessing the risk of sudden cardiac death or other heart diseases based on electrocardiograms and cardiac MRI images, identifying skin lesions in skin images and finding indicators of diabetic retinopathy in eye images.

There is plenty of good data available in all these cases, so the algorithm usually provides good results. Moreover, the algorithm can provide results in a fraction of a second, and the results can be reproduced inexpensively all over the world.

AI-based CAD systems have made some dramatic advances in the treatment of neurological disorders. [2] The future research can be made in one of the three directions: creation of a large public database for the validation of all developed techniques, ML-based CAD for early detection of neurological disorders, and remote access by non-expert clinicians.

IBM Watson was used to identify all RBPs (RNA-binding protein) in the genome and identify new RBPs linked to ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). IBM Watson extracted features from published literature to create semantic similarities and identify new connections between entities of interest [3].  IBM Watson analysed all published extracts of previously known ALS-RBPs, and applied that text based knowledge to all RBPs in the genome, ranking them by semantic similarity to the known set.

### Developing drugs:

AI can be used to develop drugs faster and in a more effective way. There are four key stages in drug development, and AI can be used to improvise each step.

For stage 1, machine learning algorithms can more easily analyze all the available data and even learn to automatically identify good target proteins. 

For stage 2, the algorithms can help predict the suitability of a molecule based structural fingerprints and molecular descriptors. 

For stage 3, the algorithms can speed up clinical trials by automatically identifying suitable candidates as well as ensuring the correct distribution for groups of trial participants. They can identify candidates that separate the good from the bad. 

For stage 4, AI can also help in screening biomarkers, where it is needed to screen tens of thousands of biomarkers.

### Applications in radiology:

A long-awaited meta-analysis compared the performance of deep learning software and radiologists in the field of imaging-based diagnosis. [4] Deep learning seems to be as efficient as radiologists for diagnosis, the authors pointed out that 99% of the studies were found not to have a reliable design. Furthermore, one thousandth of the papers that were reviewed validated their results by having algorithms diagnose medical imaging coming from other source populations. These findings support the need for an extensive validation of AI-based technologies through rigorous clinical trials. [5]


AI can be used in radiology to classify brain tumors, detect hidden fractures, recognize breast cancers and detect neurological abnormalities. [8] The details of these methods are discussed below: 

AI can detect three main types of brain tumors in the posterior fossa part of the brain. Such tumors are the most common causes of cancer-related death among children. If surgeons know which variant the patient has in advance, they can prepare a more efficient treatment plan.

A study published in the European Journal of Radiology demonstrates the potential of employing Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to help  radiologists identify fractures. DCNN can identify can identify defects in MRI and CT scans that escapes the human eye.

A study conducted by Korean academic hospitals used an AI based tool developed by Dr. Lunit to aid radiologists in mammography screenings. The study found that radiologists’ accuracy increased from 75.3% to 84.8% when they used AI. The algorithm was particularly good at detecting early stage invasive cancers. 

AI in radiology has the potential to diagnose neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by tracking retinal movements. This analysis takes place within around 10 seconds. Another approach to spotting neurological abnormalities is through speech analysis, since Alzheimer’s changes patients’ language patterns.

### Can deep learning be a replacement for doctors?

"CNNs (convolutional neural networks) are not replacement solutions for medical doctors, but will contribute to optimize routine tasks and thus have a potential positive impact on our practice. Specialties with a strong visual component such as radiology and pathology will be deeply transformed by CNNs but all the fields of medical and surgical practice will be affected by this technology.[6] The role of practitioners is key for developing and implementing such devices. Doctors have a historical chance to take part in a scientific revolution by understanding deep learning, taking part in the concept and evaluation of new devices but also by contributing to receive a framework for the regulation of this type of medical activity." -  Deep learning in medical image analysis: A third eye for doctors - PubMed (nih.gov)
